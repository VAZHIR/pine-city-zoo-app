                <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                <p>Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump.
                    Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge
                    of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the
                    blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white
                    'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight
                    horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black
                    on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare color morph is
                    the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golde</p>
                <p>Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length. From a
                    distance, the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters
                    mistake females for males each year. In males horns tend to be thicker with larger bases. Females
                    have slightly longer, thinner horns</p>
                <p>Gemsbok are social animals, living in herds of up to 40 individuals. They are known for their ability
                    to
                    survive in arid environments, as they can go long periods without water by obtaining moisture from
                    the vegetation they consume. Their diet primarily consists of grasses, leaves, and shoots.</p>
                <p>Gemsbok are also known for their unique behavior of digging shallow depressions in the ground to
                    create
                    "wallow pits," which they use to cool themselves during hot weather. These pits can also serve as a
                    source of water for other animals in the area.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>WHERE TO FIND THEM</h3>
                <p>Gemsbok are primarily found in the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like
                    Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and parts of Angola. They inhabit savannas, grasslands, and
                    semi-desert areas where they can find sufficient vegetation for grazing.</p>
                <p>In Namibia, the Etosha National Park is a popular destination for observing gemsbok in their natural
                    habitat. The park's vast plains and waterholes attract these magnificent animals, making it an ideal
                    location for wildlife enthusiasts and photographers.</p>
