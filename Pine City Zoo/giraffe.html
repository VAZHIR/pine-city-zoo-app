                <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. They inhabit savannas and
                    open woodlands in Africa, primarily feeding on leaves from tall trees. Their unique coat patterns
                    help them blend into their environment, providing camouflage from predators.</p>
                <p>Giraffes are social animals, often found in loose herds. They communicate through a variety of
                    vocalizations and body language. Their long necks allow them to reach high foliage, but they also
                    use them in combat, swinging their necks to strike rivals.</p>
                <p>These gentle giants are known for their calm demeanor and graceful movements. Giraffes have a unique
                    way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body at the same time, which gives them a
                    distinctive gait. They can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour in short bursts.</p>
                <p>Giraffes are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and poaching. Conservation efforts
                    are underway to protect their habitats and ensure their survival in the wild. Visiting giraffes in
                    zoos or wildlife reserves can help raise awareness about their conservation needs.</p>
                <p>Giraffes are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with populations spread across various countries
                    including Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Namibia. They thrive in open savannas and grasslands
                    where they can easily access their preferred food sources.</p>
                <h3>WHERE TO FIND THEM</h3>
                <p>Giraffes can be found in various regions across Africa, particularly in savannas and open woodlands.
