                <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest primates and are known for their intelligence and strong social bonds.</p>
                <p>They live in groups called troops, led by a dominant silverback</p>
                <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruit.</p>
                <p>They are critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
                <p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and reduce poaching.</p>
                <p>Gorillas communicate through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions.</p>
                <p>They are known for their gentle nature, despite their size and strength.</p>
                <p>Gorillas play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to disperse seeds and maintain forest
                    health.</p>
                <p>Observing gorillas in the wild can be a profound experience, offering insights into their complex
                    social structures and behaviors.</p>
                <h3>WHERE TO FIND THEM</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are primarily found in the tropical forests of central and western Africa. Some of the best
                    places to observe gorillas in their natural habitat include:</p>
