                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling
                    lifestyle. They have a thick, grey fur coat, large round ears, and a flat nose. Koalas primarily
                    feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrition but high in moisture. They spend most of their
                    time sleeping or resting in trees, using their strong claws to grip branches. Koalas are generally
                    solitary animals, but they can be found in small groups during mating season.</p>
                <p>Koalas are known for their unique vocalizations, which can be heard during the breeding season. They
                    have a low reproductive rate
                    and typically give birth to a single joey, which stays in the mother's pouch for several months
                    before emerging. Koalas are vulnerable to habitat loss, bushfires, and disease, leading to
                    significant declines in their populations in some areas. Conservation efforts are underway to
                    protect their habitats and ensure their survival.</p>
                <p>Koalas have a highly specialized diet, feeding almost exclusively on certain species of eucalyptus
                    leaves, which are toxic to most other animals. Their digestive system is adapted to detoxify these
                    chemicals, allowing them to extract the necessary nutrients and water. Despite their cuddly
                    appearance, koalas are wild animals and can be quite territorial. They communicate with each other
                    through a range of vocalizations and scent markings. Koalas play an important role in their
                    ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of eucalyptus forests.</p>
                <p>Koalas are primarily found in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern coasts of
                    Australia. They prefer areas with abundant food sources and suitable tree species for shelter. Some
                    of the best places to observe koalas in their natural habitat include:</p>
