                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <p>Lions are known as the "king of the jungle" and are one of the most iconic big cats.</p>
                <p>They live in prides, which are social groups consisting of related females, their offspring, and a
                    small number of adult males.</p>
                <p>Lions are apex predators, primarily hunting large herbivores such as zebras and wildebeests.</p>
                <p>They are known for their powerful roar, which can be heard up to five miles away.</p>
                <p>Lions have a unique social structure, with females typically doing most of the hunting while males
                    protect the pride's territory.</p>
                <p>Conservation efforts are crucial for lions, as they face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife
                    conflict, and poaching.</p>
                <p>Lions are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in the Gir Forest of India.
                </p>
                <h3>WHERE TO FIND THEM</h3>
                <p>Lions can be found in various regions across Africa, particularly in savannas and grasslands. Some of
                    the best places to observe lions in their natural habitat include:</p>
