                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals native to China. They are known for their distinctive black and
                    white fur and primarily feed on bamboo. Pandas are considered a symbol of conservation efforts due
                    to their endangered status.</p>
                <p>Pandas are solitary animals, spending most of their time eating and resting. They have a unique
                    digestive system that allows them to process bamboo efficiently, despite its low nutritional value.
                    Pandas are also known for their playful behavior, especially when they are young.</p>
                <p>In the wild, pandas inhabit mountainous regions where bamboo is abundant. They are excellent climbers
                    and can often be seen resting in trees. Conservation efforts have been made to protect their natural
                    habitat and increase their population, as they were once on the brink of extinction.</p>
                <p>Pandas are beloved worldwide and are often featured in zoos and wildlife parks. Their gentle demeanor
                    and playful antics have made them a favorite among animal lovers. Efforts to study and protect
                    pandas continue, with the hope of ensuring their survival for future generations.</p>
                <p>Pandas have a special bone in their wrist that acts like a thumb, helping them grasp bamboo stalks.
                    Despite being classified as carnivores, over 99% of a panda's diet consists of bamboo. Baby pandas
                    are born pink, blind, and very small, weighing about 1/900th the size of their mother. Pandas can
                    eat up to 38 kilograms (about 84 pounds) of bamboo every day. Each panda has a unique pattern of
                    black patches around its eyes, ears, and body, much like a human fingerprint.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>WHERE TO FIND THEM</h3>
                <p>Pandas are primarily found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan,
                    Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. Some of the best places to observe pandas in their natural habitat
