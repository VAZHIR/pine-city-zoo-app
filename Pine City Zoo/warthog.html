                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>Warthogs are wild pigs found in Africa, known for their distinctive tusks and bristly hair. They are
                    well adapted to their environment, often seen foraging for roots and tubers. Warthogs can run
                    surprisingly fast and are known to dig with their snouts to find food.</p>
                <p>These animals are social and often live in groups called sounders, which typically consist of females
                    and their young, while males tend to be more solitary.</p>
                <p>Warthogs have a unique way of defending themselves; they can run away from predators or use their
                    tusks to fight back. They are also known for their habit of wallowing in mud, which helps them
                    regulate their body temperature and protect their skin from parasites.</p>
                <p>Warthogs play an important role in their ecosystem by helping to aerate the soil and control
                    vegetation through their foraging habits. They are also prey for larger predators like lions and
                    hyenas, making them a key part of the food chain.</p>
                <p>Conservation efforts are important for warthogs, as they face threats from habitat loss and hunting.
                    Protecting their natural habitats and ensuring sustainable practices can help maintain healthy
                    populations of these fascinating animals.</p>
                <p>Warthogs are often seen in savannas, grasslands, and woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. They are
                    well adapted to their environment and can thrive in a variety of habitats.</p>
                <h3>WHERE TO FIND THEM</h3>
                <p>Warthogs can be found in various regions across sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in savannas,
                    grasslands, and woodlands. Some of the best places to observe warthogs include:</p>
